## Integrations

These are some popular and user friendly OS integrations, providing things like system tray icons, file browser integration, etc. These are good starting points if you are a new user unfamiliar with Syncthing, or not prone to loving the command line.

- **[syncthing-macos](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos/releases/latest)**:
  macOS application bundle
- **[Syncthing Windows Setup](https://github.com/Bill-Stewart/SyncthingWindowsSetup/)**: a lightweight yet full-featured Windows installer

There's a wealth of further integrations of all kinds listed on the [community
contributions](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html) page. Each
integration has their own issue tracker for integration-specific issues, but
discussion and assistance for all of them is welcome on the
[forum](https://forum.syncthing.net/).

## Linux distribution packages

Syncthing is available out-of-the-box as part of many Linux distributions,
though often not with the most up-to-date version. We also maintain packages
and installation instructions for **Debian** & **Ubuntu** at
[apt.syncthing.net](https://apt.syncthing.net).

## Base Syncthing

This is the basic Syncthing distribution, providing a command line / daemon like
executable and a web based user interface.

please use the "Intel/AMD (64-bit)" build for your operating system. If you're
running on an oddball system such as a NAS, please consult your vendor.
